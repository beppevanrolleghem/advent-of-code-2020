# TODO

Fix the typing thing. better loops


# Task 1

i feel like a dumbass. It's pretty straight forward, however:

loop through each string, parse each string correctly (get max and min amounts and the char). then loop through the
final char, every time a char compare is true, add to the count, if count is bigger then max we can quit before hand.
afterwards in the end check if lower then min.

mainly forgot that it was amount of valid instead of invalid. So....


# Task 2

since i already have the string converted as an array, just a matter of utilizing the usize and int types correctly.
Which i truly didnt, i will also have to come back to this later to improve it.
