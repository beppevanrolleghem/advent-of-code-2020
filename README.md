# advent-of-code-2020
Guessing my way through advent of code 2020
Also, i'm going to "make this harder" for myself by picking a different coding language each day. Or at least trying to.
:^)


## update
so yea, i gave up on the different coding languages for now. I dont have the time to look up syntax all day and work.
And when i'm not working, i really try to enjoy my me-time. so for now, it's python only
